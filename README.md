# Go Calculator

Welcome to my **Go Calculator** project! ðŸŽ‰

This project marks the beginning of my journey into learning the **Go programming language**. I started exploring Go for its simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for building robust applications. To kick off my learning experience, I created this basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Add (`+`) two numbers
- Subtract (`-`) one number from another
- Multiply (`*`) two numbers
- Divide (`/`) one number by another (with error handling for division by zero)

## Usage

### Requirements
- **Go**: Ensure you have Go installed. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/).

### Running the Calculator
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaurikarkhile001/Calculator-Golang.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd go-calculator
   ```
3. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   go run calculator.go
   ```

### Example
```plaintext
Welcome to the Go Calculator
Enter the first number:
10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /):
*
Enter the second number:
5
Result: 50.00
```

## Lessons Learned
- Setting up a Go development environment
- Using basic Go constructs like `fmt`, `switch`, and `if` statements
- Handling user input and output with `fmt.Scanln`
- Implementing error checks (e.g., handling division by zero)

## Next Steps
- Add more features to the calculator, like exponentiation or modulus operations
- Learn about Go packages and modularize the code
- Build a web-based calculator using **Go** and frameworks like **Gin** or **Fiber**
